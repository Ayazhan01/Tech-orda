            Twelve years before the start of the main events, the Nine-Tails attacked the Hidden Leaf Village, destroying most of the village and claiming many lives. The village's leader, the Fourth Hokage, sacrificed himself to seal the Nine-Tails in a newborn
            boy, Naruto Uzumaki. Orphaned by the attack, Naruto was shunned by the villagers who, out of fear and anger, saw him as the Nine-Tails himself. Despite the fact that the Third Hokage forbade talking about anything related to the Nine-Tails,
            the children mentally adopted their dislike from their parents, and thus inherited hostility towards Naruto. Wanting to be recognized, Naruto vowed to one day become the greatest Hokage the village had ever seen.
